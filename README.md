**Semantic Segmentation Project**

This repository contains the code and resources for performing semantic segmentation tasks using deep learning techniques. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments and assigning a class label to each segment, thus understanding the image at the pixel level.

### Overview
Semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in various fields such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, satellite image analysis, and more. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for semantic segmentation tasks, offering a range of models, datasets, and utilities for experimentation and deployment.
